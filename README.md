# FlexOS: Making OS Isolation Flexible

This repository contains the main tree of our FlexOS proof-of-concept. FlexOS
aims to decouple isolation from the design of the OS. FlexOS is a cooperation
between the University of Manchester, University Politehnica of Bucharest, and
NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH. It has been published in HotOS'21 and ASPLOS'22.

> **Abstract**:  At design time, modern operating systems are locked in a
> specific safety and isolation strategy that mixes one or more
> hardware/software protection mechanisms (e.g. user/kernel separation);
> revisiting these choices after deployment requires a major refactoring effort.
> This rigid approach shows its limits given the wide variety of modern
> applications' safety/performance requirements, when new hardware isolation
> mechanisms are rolled out, or when existing ones break.
>
> We present FlexOS, a novel OS allowing users to easily specialize the
> safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time
> instead of design time. This modular LibOS is composed of fine-grained
> components that can be isolated via a range of hardware protection mechanisms
> with various data sharing strategies and additional software hardening. The
> OS ships with an exploration technique helping the user navigate the vast
> safety/performance design space it unlocks. We implement a prototype of the
> system and demonstrate, for several applications (Redis/Nginx/SQLite),
> FlexOSâ€™ vast configuration space as well as the efficiency of the
> exploration technique: we evaluate 80 FlexOS configurations for Redis and
> show how that space can be probabilistically subset to the 5 safest ones under
> a given performance budget. We also show that, under equivalent
> configurations, FlexOS performs similarly or better than several
> baselines/competitors.

## Installing from the Docker container

Clone this repository and build the Docker container:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:project-flexos/unikraft.git
$ pushd unikraft/docker
$ docker build -f flexos.dockerfile --tag flexos-dev .
$ popd
```

If the build fails because you are rate-limited by GitHub, generate an app
token
([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token))
and run instead:

```
$ docker build --build-arg UK_KRAFT_GITHUB_TOKEN="<YOUR TOKEN>" --tag flexos-dev
```

Run the container as following:

```
$ docker run --privileged -ti flexos-dev bash
```

## Installing from source

The easiest approach to install FlexOS on your native system is to follow the
Dockerfile instructions in `docker/flexos.dockerfile`. Note that the
recommended system is Debian 10. We strongly recommend the Docker-based
approach.

## Building FlexOS

Applies to both Docker & installation from source.

Configure Redis with two compartments:

```
$ cd ~/.unikraft/apps/redis
$ cat ./kraft.yaml
---
specification: '0.6'
name: redis
unikraft:
  version: staging
  kconfig:
    - CONFIG_LIBUK9P=y
    - CONFIG_LIB9PFS=y
    - CONFIG_LIBDEVFS=y
    - CONFIG_LIBDEVFS_AUTOMOUNT=y
    - CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS=y
    - CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_RAMFS=y
    - CONFIG_LIBUKLIBPARAM=y
    - CONFIG_LIBUKDEBUG=y
    - CONFIG_LIBUKALLOC=y
    - CONFIG_LIBUKSCHED=y
    - CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_SYSINFO=y
    - CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_LIBDL=y
    - CONFIG_LIBFLEXOS=y
targets:
  - architecture: x86_64
    platform: kvm
compartments:
  - name: comp1
    mechanism:
      driver: intel-pku
      noisolstack: false
    default: true
  - name: comp2
    mechanism:
      driver: intel-pku
      noisolstack: false
libraries:
  tlsf:
    version: staging
    kconfig:
      - CONFIG_LIBTLSF=y
  pthread-embedded:
    version: staging
    compartment: comp1
  newlib:
    version: staging
    kconfig:
      - CONFIG_LIBNEWLIBC=y
      - CONFIG_LIBNEWLIBC_WANT_IO_C99_FORMATS=y
      - CONFIG_LIBNEWLIBC_LINUX_ERRNO_EXTENSIONS=y
    compartment: comp1
  lwip:
    version: staging
    kconfig:
      - CONFIG_LWIP_IPV6=y
    compartment: comp2
  redis:
    version: staging
    kconfig:
      - CONFIG_LIBREDIS_SERVER=y
      - CONFIG_LIBREDIS_COMMON=y
      - CONFIG_LIBREDIS_LIBREDIS_LUA=y
      - CONFIG_LIBREDIS_SERVER_MAIN_FUNCTION=y
    compartment: comp1
volumes: {}
networks: {}
$ kraft configure
```

Now we have a fully set up system. We only have to build and run. The following
commands are what you would run as part of your development workflow.

Build Redis with two MPK compartments:

```
$ make prepare && kraft -v build --no-progress --fast --compartmentalize
```

Run the freshly built image:

```
$ kraft run --initrd ./redis.cpio -M 1024 ""
```

## FlexOS `kraft.yaml` primer

In addition to this documentation, you can find examples of `kraft.yaml` files
with MPK, EPT, and function call instanciation in our [AE
repository](https://github.com/project-flexos/asplos22-ae).

### Declaring Compartments

Declare compartments in `compartments`:

```
compartments:
  - name: comp1
    mechanism:
      driver: intel-pku
      noisolstack: false
    default: true
  - name: comp2
    mechanism:
      driver: intel-pku
      noisolstack: false
```

Each compartment has a `name` and a `mechanism`.

Each mechanism has a driver (for Intel MPK/PKU it's `intel-pku`, for VM-based
`vmept`, for simple function calls `fcalls`), and possibly a number of
driver-specific options. Intel MPK/PKU, for instance, can isolate or share the
stack (`noisolstack`).

There is one `default` compartment. All libraries that have not been assigned a
specific compartment will go into the default compartment.

:warning: If you declare a compartment, make sure to actually use it! That is,
it should either be default or used by a library (see below).

### Assign compartments to libraries

Libraries can be assigned a compartment using `compartment`:

```
libraries:
[...]
  lwip:
    version: staging
    kconfig:
      - CONFIG_LWIP_IPV6=y
    compartment: comp2
```

The value has to match the name of a previously declared compartment.

Note that internal libraries (the ones whose source live under `unikraft/`)
require an additional `is_core: true` parameter:

```
libraries:
[...]
  uksched:
    is_core: true
    compartment: comp2
  ukschedcoop:
    is_core: true
    compartment: comp2
```

:warning: always put uksched and ukschedcoop together.

## Development Workflow

`kraft` rewrites the source code of microlibraries **in-place** to implement
isolation primitives. If you change the isolation profile of the image (by
editing `kraft.yaml`), make sure to thoroughly cleanup your setup.

Here is a script that does it:

```
#!/bin/bash

git checkout .
make properclean
# git checkout . && git clean -xdf in all repositories would be fine too
rm -rf ~/.kraftcache ~/.unikraft/libs ~/.unikraft/unikraft
kraft list update
kraft list pull flexos-microbenchmarks@staging iperf@staging newlib@staging \
		tlsf@staging flexos-example@staging lwip@staging redis@staging \
		unikraft@staging pthread-embedded@staging nginx@staging
```

We recommend putting this in `/usr/local/bin/kraftcleanup`. This is done automatically
by the Docker container.

The usual workflow is then:

```
$ kraftcleanup # clean
$ make prepare && kraft -v build --no-progress --fast --compartmentalize
$ kraft run [...] # run
```

:warning: Once again, if you do not run `kraftcleanup`, running `kraft build --compartmentalize` **will not** rewrite your code again because the rewriting is done in-place!

:warning: `kraftcleanup` will **erase any modification done in your build repositories**! Make sure to have separate repositories that you use for the actual development otherwise you might **loose data**!

:warning: Running `make prepare` before `kraft ... --fast ...` is necessary because of a bug in the Unikraft toolchain; the `prepare` rule does not support parallel execution.

## Backend-specific instructions

### Intel MPK/PKU

:warning: You can build on any machine, but **running requires a CPU that supports MPK**!

Generally, if you don't have a Xeon Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum, you don't have MPK. You can try running the image, if your CPU doesn't support MPK, FlexOS will abort with an appropriate error message.

### VM/EPT

For the shared memory on KVM, we use a simple shared memory device in QEMU. To add this new device to QEMU, it is necessary to compile it from source code and add a patch. More information on how to build QEMU for Linux can be found [here](https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Linux).
Steps for building QEMU for x86_64 architecture, with support for the shared memory device:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu.git
$ cd qemu
$ git apply 0001-Myshmem.patch
$ ./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu
$ vim build/build.ninja # add -lrt to LINK_ARGS for the target qemu-system-x86_64
$ make -j8
$ build/qemu-system-x86_64 -device myshmem,file=/test,size=0x1000,paddr=0x10000000 # example run to check if the device works
```

The above built QEMU binary should be used to run all Unikraft images that use the VM/EPT backend in FlexOS. You can find 0001-Myshmem.patch in this repository under `flexos-support`.

Additional remark regarding the `LINK_ARGS` edit. The relevant line is the one that begins with `LINK_ARGS = `, following the the line that begins with `build qemu-system-x86_64`.

To build the simple [example application](https://github.com/project-flexos/app-flexos-example), it has to be cloned twice. The two applications, in the `apps/` folder, could have, for example, the names `app-flexos-example` and `rpc-flexos-example`.

Currently, to build any VM/EPT image, the lwip library has to be included in the build (there are wrappers written for functions from lwip, which yield undefined symbols otherwise). TODO: add compiler guards to wrappers to mitigate this issue. To include the lwip library to the build, add `$(UK_LIBS)/lwip` to the `Makefile` and adding `lwip` to the `kraft.yaml`, putting it in `comp1` (make sure to do this in both folders - app and rpc). Also, all internal libraries that have wrapper functions defined (for example, `ukswrand`) also have to be included in the build, in `make menuconfig`.

Steps to build the VM/EPT FlexOS (beginning from `~/.unikraft/apps`):
```
$ cd app-flexos-example
$ make menuconfig # select VM/EPT in Library Configuration -> flexos -> FlexOS backend and also the KVM platform in Platform Configuration
$ make fetch
$ kraft -v build --compartmentalize
$ cd ../rpc-flexos-example
$ make fetch
$ make menuconfig # select VM/EPT in Library Configuration -> flexos -> FlexOS backend
		  # AND select 'Build a library compartment (not main app)'
$ kraft -v build --compartmentalize
```

To run the application, the RPC server has to be run first and then the application (first you run `rpc-flexos-example` and then `app-flexos-example`).
Here is an example command for running the built compartments:
```
<PATH TO QEMU BUILT EARLIER>/qemu/build/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nographic -device isa-debug-exit -gdb tcp::1237 \
	-device myshmem,file=/rpc,paddr=0x800000000,size=0x100000 \
	-device myshmem,file=/heap,paddr=0x4000000000,size=0x8000000 \
	-device myshmem,file=/data_shared,paddr=0x105000,size=<size of data_shared section> \
	-kernel $KERNEL \
	-m 2G \
```

Replace the path to QEMU with the path on your system. To find out the size of the data_shared section, run the following command on the built compartments:
```
$ readelf -SW ~/.unikraft/apps/app-flexos-example/build/app-flexos-example_kvm-x86_64.dbg
[...]

```

### Function Calls (Debugging Backend)

The `fcalls` debugging backend will replace all gates with simple function calls. You can build it on any machine and run it on any machine.

## Porting Tips & Tricks

### Gate insertion with MPK (and other intra-AS isolation technologies)

The first part of porting a library to run as isolated component is to insert gates.

It can be hard to ensure that all function calls to the component's API are wrapped with gates if the component doesn't have much internal data; without internal data accesses, technologies such as MPK might not trigger a crash if a gate is missing.

In order to ensure that *all* function calls to the components API trigger a crash if a gate is missing, we can leverage GCC's instrumentation `-finstrument-functions`. With this instrumentation, we can make sure that each function of the target library writes to a library local variable before executing. If a gate is missing, it will crash.

For this you simply have to add the compiler flag to the relevant library, e.g., for uktime:

```
diff --git a/lib/uktime/Makefile.uk b/lib/uktime/Makefile.uk
index 8e05ed7..ca1f085 100644
--- a/lib/uktime/Makefile.uk
+++ b/lib/uktime/Makefile.uk

Then compile as usual. The image will crash if gates are missing.
